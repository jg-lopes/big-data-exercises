# Spark-exercises

Big Data exercises using Spark and Map Reduce

The Map Reduce exercises contain theoretical exercises about modelization of Map Reduce compliant data pipelines. Thus, they were coded in raw Python with more concern about theoretical conformity than efficiency.

The Spark exercises, however, were coded using pyspark and were done in order to maximize efficiency.

These exercises were prosed by the Big Data Algorithms Techniques & Platforms course inside of the MSc of Data Sciences and Business Analytics by CentraleSup√©lec and ESSEC Business School
